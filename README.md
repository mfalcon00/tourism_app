# Tourism in the world

Tourism plays a vital role in the global economy, contributing to employment, cultural exchange, and the development of infrastructure. Tourism statistics are essential for understanding the patterns and dynamics of travel and tourism, helping stakeholders such as governments, businesses, and policymakers make informed decisions.

These statistics encompass a wide range of data, including the number of visitors to a destination, their spending and the impacts of tourism on local economy. The data used for this project has been extracted from UN Tourism: https://www.unwto.org/ and The World Bank.

Two sections in this project:
- EDA : to explore tourism data to uncover insights
- Prediction : to forecast the inbound volume for the top 5 countries
